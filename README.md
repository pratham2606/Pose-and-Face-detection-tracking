This project implements an advanced pose and facial landmark detection system utilizing OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for real-time pose and facial feature extraction.
The architecture of the system is built upon the poseDetector class, which harnesses the power of Mediapipe’s sophisticated pose estimation model.
By processing frames in real-time, it leverages dynamic landmark mapping to detect key human body points with high accuracy, incorporating multi-stage image transformation and conversion techniques.
The pose detection module is intricately designed to function with customizable parameters such as model complexity, landmark smoothing, and detection/tracking confidence thresholds.
This ensures flexibility in optimizing performance for various use cases. In addition, a highly efficient pipeline processes input video frames by converting them to RGB for enhanced detection accuracy, with visual feedback provided through detailed skeletal overlays using Mediapipe’s drawing utilities.
